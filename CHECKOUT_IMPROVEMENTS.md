# Checkout Process Improvements

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Removed "Bag Cleared Successfully" Toast on Purchase
- **Problem**: When users proceeded with purchase, they saw a confusing "تم مسح الحقيبة بالكامل" (Bag cleared successfully) message
- **Solution**: 
  - Modified `clearBag()` function to accept optional `showToast` parameter
  - Updated checkout form to call `clearBag(false)` after successful purchase
  - Toast message only shows when manually clearing bag, not during checkout

### 2. Made Checkout Process More Snappy
- **Performance Improvements**:
  - Reduced toast notification duration from 2000ms to 1500ms
  - Reduced bag clearing delay from 500ms to 200ms
  - Removed unnecessary form validation scrolling during submission
  - Optimized real-time validation for better responsiveness

## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

### BagContext.tsx
```typescript
// Before
const clearBag = useCallback(() => {
  setItems([]);
  setTimeout(() => {
    toast.success('تم مسح الحقيبة بالكامل', {
      icon: '🧹',
      duration: 2000,
    });
  }, 0);
}, []);

// After
const clearBag = useCallback((showToast: boolean = true) => {
  setItems([]);
  if (showToast) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      toast.success('تم مسح الحقيبة بالكامل', {
        icon: '🧹',
        duration: 1500,
      });
    }, 0);
  }
}, []);
```

### CheckoutForm.tsx
```typescript
// Before
if (result.ok && result.id) {
  clearBag();
  router.push(`/success?id=${result.id}`);
}

// After
if (result.ok && result.id) {
  clearBag(false); // Don't show toast when clearing after successful purchase
  router.push(`/success?id=${result.id}`);
}
```

### BagPage.tsx
```typescript
// Before
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));

// After
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 200));
```

### Types.ts
```typescript
// Updated interface
clearBag: (showToast?: boolean) => void;
```
